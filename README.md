Rules:
The time limit for the test is 5h maximum, that you can split in the way you want. When you
are done, please send us your source code (via GitHub) so that we can make a code review.
Please also attach a README.md document in which youâ€™ll mention

1. The time it took you to perform the exercise: 
I've taken about 5:15 hours in "complete" the exercise, one of which I've wasted trying to figure out how Git Hub works and attempting to download the specifc Unity version (Seriously, If you need us to use a bunch of specific softwares, let us know before the challenge starts, not during)

2. The parts that were difficult for you and why:
Understand Github =D
In fact, It was not a difficult game, the only difficult i found was to calculate te exact percentage of randomness in case the user put manually values that are not equal to 100 in her maxmimum value (of course i don't even have time to download the game and try it, so, under suspicion if it was or not made procedurally, i had to do it that way)

3. The parts you think you could do better and how
ignoring art related things (one of my favorite parts), with a little more time i could make more types of roads and "Enemies" to do it  even more random. I would have increse the efficiency of the random generator on the first frame. I would ad coins and time to get a final score. And of course I would unify this onto a better UI. I don't consider them to be difficult things, just entertaining. The only part that I can't do is Networkin. I wouldn't even know where to start. Also, one thing that I would have liked to improve a lot is the code comments. I haven't had much time to write them and I'm afraid to understand my strange way of thinking is quite difficult sometimes if I don't detail it step by step. I always do it, but you know, a count-down is a count-down

4. What you would do if you could go a step further on this game
well... ignoring the things I said before (art, more art, other trail parts, other enemies, coins, UI and Networking) I think there would be great to ad World Score Ranking, One-Chance Count-Down mode, try some things to make a Single Player mode that were a real challenge

5. What did you think
The only thing I can think of right now is in my dinner

6. Any comment you may have
well, I think the "If you need to use specific softwares" part is important. On the other hand, it was a very funny exercise. A very simple game but out of the ordinary way with ideas that i never tried before. Great decision!
